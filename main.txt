echo and print are more or less the same. 
They are both used to output data to the screen.
The echo statement can be used with or without parenthesis: echo or echo().
The print statement can be used with or without parenthesis: print or print().

The differences are small: 
  a) echo has no return value while print has a return value of 1 so it can be used in expressions.
  b) echo can take multiple parameters (although such usage is rare) while print can take one argument.
  c) echo is marginally faster than print
